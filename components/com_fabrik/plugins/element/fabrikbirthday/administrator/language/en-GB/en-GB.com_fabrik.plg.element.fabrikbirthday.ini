BD_EXAMPLE=<b>A brief tutorial</b>
BD_EXAMPLEDESC=Table view of people and their birthdays (anniversaries) is present, the format / detail views as well. But how to show the list next year's jubilees? <br><br> 1) Make a copy of the existing Fabrik table <br> 2) in your new table, find the Born / Deceased element which shows the birthday's. Open it and remove the link to the parent element. Now you can change the properties of that element. <br> 3) in 'Table View: age / anniversary' select 'Next year's anniversaries' <br> Now your new table shows all at all bd-s/anv-s what bd/anv would be next year and also their birth dates (format depends of your choosen date format). Example: 44 (23.06.1967)  Jubilarian's bd/anv is highlighted (bold text). Example: <b>500 (June 23, 1511)</b><br /><br> OK, but you only want jubilarians? <br> In this case, you need to add a prefilter to this table view: 'tables_pk' 'IN', 'SELECT FROM table WHERE tables_pk SUBSTRING ((YEAR (DATE_ADD (CURDATE (), INTERVAL 1 YEAR)) - YEAR (bd_anv_field)), -2) IN ('00' , '10 ', '20', '25 ', '30', '40 ', '50', '60 ', '70', '75 ', '80', '90 ')' and as value type select 'Query'.
