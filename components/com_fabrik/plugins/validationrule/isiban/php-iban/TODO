 - Finnish record suggests position at which to pad domestic account
   numbers in order to reach a BBAN / IBAN, this data could be of
   some use for certain applications and would be nice to include
 - Support for calculating or validating any known national (sub-
   BBAN-level) checksum algorithms would also be nice
 - Any references to national-level BBAN format specifications
   would also be useful
