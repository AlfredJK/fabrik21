DISPLAYDATADESC=Select which info about the current logged in use you want to display in your tables and forms. Note: the user's ID is always stored in the database table
UPDATEONEDITDESC=If yes selected then the current users id will be stored when they edit the record. If no is selected then the user id is only stored when a new record is created
UPDATEONCOPYDESC=If yes selected then the current users id will be stored when 'save as copy' button is used, so the element will take on the id of the user who copies the form.
PLG_ELEMENT_FABRIKUSER_USE_SOCIAL_PROFILE=Use Social Profile
PLG_ELEMENT_FABRIKUSER_USE_SOCIAL_PROFILE_DESC=If enabled, when creating a new record session data will be checked for fabrik.social.profile_id, and if present will be used as the user ID.  This is set by (for instance) the CB Plugin to the user ID of the profile being viewed.
