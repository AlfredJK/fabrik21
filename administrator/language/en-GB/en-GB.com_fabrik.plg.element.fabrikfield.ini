DATESHOWTIME=Show time selector
DATESHOWTIMEDESC=Add a widget to select a time
GUESSLINKTYPE=Guess link type
GUESSLINKTYPEDESC=Will intelligently guess the link type (url or mailto) and convert this elements data into a link. Works for both table views, readonly forms and readonly elements
GUESSLINKTARGET=Add target to link
GUESSLINKTARGETDESC=Set on Yes if you want to add the target attribute to the link
TARGETOPTIONS=Choose target for the link
TARGETOPTIONSDESC=If Add target to link set to Yes, choose which target you want to use for the link
NOT SET=Default
TARGETSELF=Open in this window / frame
TARGETBLANK=Open in new window
TARGETPARENT=Open in parent window / frame
TARGETTOP=Open in top frame
DISABLEELEMENT=Disable element
DISABLEELEMENTDESC=Completely disable the element, user not allowed to change the value, and data NOT submitted with the form
READONLY=Read only
READONLYDESC=Display the element as normal, but disallow the user to change the value. The field IS submitted with the form
AUTOCOMPLETE=Auto complete
AUTOCOMPLETEDESC=If set to yes then the browser will show the user previously entered values as options when typing
USENUMBERFORMAT=Number Format
USENUMBERFORMATDESC=If yes, value will be processed thru PHP's number_format() function, which will insert thousand separators, and use the decimal point you specify below.  So (for instance) to format French numbers, you would use a Thousand Separator of '#32' (=space, see tooltip of thousand sep below) and a Decimal Point of '.'.  Will also use the Decimal Length specified above, rounding the number if necessary.  Formatting is only applied when rendering the number in a table or detail view, does not affect how the value is stored in the table.  NOTE that number_format() will be applied BEFORE any sprintf() format you may specify below, which may mean that sprintf may not recognize the value as a number.
FIELDTHOUSANDSEP=Thousand Separator
FIELDTHOUSANDSEPDESC=If you selected Yes for Number Format, this will be used as the thousand separator.  If you need to specify a space (i.e,. for French number formatting), put #32 instead (Joomla strips spaces from parameters when saving, so you can't just put a space here!).
FIELDDECIMALSEP=Decimal Point
FIELDDECIMALSEPDESC=If you selected Yes for Number Format, this will be used as the decimal point character.
